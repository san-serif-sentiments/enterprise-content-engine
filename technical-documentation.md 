# Overview
This document explains how to **set up, run, and extend** the Agentic Documentation System.  
The system turns structured inputs (briefs, API specs, feedback data) into validated, publishable outputs (API references, user guides, release notes, KB articles, and in-app guidance).

---

# Why It Matters
This guide helps developers, documentation engineers, and technical communicators:  
- Understand the folder structure and role-based architecture.  
- Run end-to-end pipelines or packet-specific workflows.  
- Customize governance policies for style and compliance.  
- Contribute new roles or extend outputs safely.  

---

# Audience, Scope & Personas
- **Technical Writers / Docs Engineers**: to see how Docs-as-Code pipelines work.  
- **Developers**: to extend roles or integrate outputs with CI/CD.  
- **Comms / Support Teams**: to leverage feedback-driven KB updates.  
- **Researchers**: to study modular, agentic workflows for content generation.  

---

# Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+**  
- Optional: `pip install pyyaml` (used for YAML parsing)  
- GitHub (if you want to run workflows in CI/CD)  

Recommended: set up a **virtual environment**.  

```

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows
pip install -U pip pyyaml
