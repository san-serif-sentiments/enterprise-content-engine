## What Shipped
- **Backup list & Restore APIs** simplify tenant management and reduce recovery steps.
- **Restore performance** improved for large objects (≈20% faster on internal benchmarks).
- Resolved **policy conflict** edge cases during schedule changes.

## Why It Matters
- Faster RTO for large tenants.
- Prevents silent policy override.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Low risk of performance regressions — mitigated via staged rollout and monitoring.

## Metrics to Watch
- Restore success rate (RTO proxy)
- Time-to-first-policy after onboarding
- KB deflection on policy conflicts
