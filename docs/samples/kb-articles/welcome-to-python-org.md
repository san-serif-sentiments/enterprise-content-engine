Python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists. More about defining functions in Python 3 # Python 3: List comprehensions >>> fruits = ['Banana'. 'Apple', 'Lime'] >>> loud_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits] >>> print(loud_fruits) ['BANANA', 'APPLE', 'LIME'] # List and the enumerate function >>> list(enumerate(fruits)) [(0, 'Banana'), (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Lime')] Compound Data Types Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound data types that Python understands.

## Why it matters
Provides external insights relevant to enterprise AI adoption.

## Guidance
Prefer troubleshooting tone; call out common misconfig steps.
Prefer enterprise adoption + risk tone.
Call out common failure modes (bias, drift, hallucination).
Highlight practical examples for L&D teams.
